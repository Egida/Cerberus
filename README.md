# Cerberus
Cerberus is a layer 7 network stress testing tool that has a wide variety of normal and exotic attack vectors. <br>
It's written in Python3 and is usable on all systems with Python installed.

# Notes
- Cloudflare bypass can't solve v2 challenges, so is therefore pretty much useless

# Depencies
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Everything can be installed with the `setup.py` script:
    - `python3 setup.py`
